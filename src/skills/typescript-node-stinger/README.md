# typescript-node-stinger

Cursor skill that equips **typescript-node-worker-bee** to be the authority on modern TypeScript/Node as it is actually written in Hivemind (`@deeplake/hivemind`) - opinionated, modern, grounded in the repo's own patterns rather than generic tutorial tropes. Encodes the real Hivemind stack as enforcement, applied across the `src/` layout, the Deep Lake SQL-API access patterns, the esbuild multi-harness bundle model, Vitest discipline, strict types + zod boundaries, the lean quality gate, and the npm publish contract.

Entry point: `SKILL.md`.

## Canonical stack (the Hivemind reality)

The product is opinionation. There is exactly one answer per slot, and it is whatever the repo already does:

| Slot | Pick | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript ^6, `strict: true` | The whole repo is TS; strict is non-negotiable |
| Module system | ESM (`"type": "module"`) | Node16 resolution; `.js` extensions on relative imports |
| Runtime | Node >=22 | `engines.node`; built-in `fetch`, top-level await, `node:` builtins |
| Compiler config | tsconfig `module: Node16`, `target: ES2022` | Read it; never loosen it |
| Bundler | esbuild (`esbuild.config.mjs`) | Per-harness bundles; version inlined via `define` |
| Tests | Vitest (`vitest run`) + `@vitest/coverage-v8` | `tests/` mirrors `harnesses/` |
| Boundary validation | zod ^4 (app), zod/v3 (MCP server) | The MCP SDK speaks v3; the app is on v4 |
| Duplication gate | jscpd (threshold 7, minLines 10 / minTokens 60) | `npm run dup` over `src` |
| Pre-commit | husky -> lint-staged (`tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck`) | No ESLint, no Prettier |
| Persistence | Activeloop Deep Lake over an HTTP SQL API | `src/deeplake-api.ts`; not Postgres/Prisma/Drizzle |
| Shell engine | just-bash (VFS) | The Deep Lake-backed shell |
| Optional deps | `@huggingface/transformers`, `tree-sitter` + grammars | Guarded loading only |

Substitution requires an ADR (`library/knowledge/private/architecture/ADR-<n>-*.md`) with eval evidence and a migration plan.

## Scope

- **Owns:** the `src/` layout and ESM import discipline, Deep Lake SQL-API access patterns, the single-sourced schema and `healMissingColumns`, the MCP server tools, the esbuild bundle model and `sync-versions.mjs`, Vitest discipline, strict-type + zod-boundary enforcement, the jscpd/husky/tsc gate, the `hivemind` CLI and `scripts/*.mjs`, and the npm publish contract.
- **Does not own:** Deep Lake table/index design from a data-engineering POV (`vector-store-worker-bee`), security audit including auth/credential lifecycle (`security-worker-bee`), recall ranking and the embeddings strategy (`retrieval-worker-bee` and `embeddings-runtime-worker-bee`), Docker / CI / cloud deploys (`ci-release-worker-bee`), PRD authoring (`library-worker-bee`), post-implementation QA (`quality-worker-bee`).

## Cross-Bee handoffs

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Deep Lake table/index design from a data-engineering POV | `vector-store-worker-bee` |
| Security audit (token handling, secret scanning, injection vectors, auth/credential lifecycle) | `security-worker-bee` |
| Recall ranking, embeddings strategy, evals | `retrieval-worker-bee` and `embeddings-runtime-worker-bee` |
| Docker, CI runners, release automation, cloud | `ci-release-worker-bee` |
| PRD authoring | `library-worker-bee` |
| Post-implementation QA | `quality-worker-bee` |

## Output convention

Reports are written into the **host repo's `library/` tree**, never inside this Stinger (there is no `reports/` subfolder in the Stinger):

- **Standalone reviews** -> `library/requirements/reports/typescript/<date>-<topic>.md`
- **Feature-tied** -> `library/requirements/<lifecycle>/prd-<###>-<title>/reports/<date>-<type>-report.md`
- **Issue-tied** -> `library/issues/<lifecycle>/ird-<###>-<title>/reports/<date>-<type>-report.md`
- **ADRs** -> `library/knowledge/private/architecture/ADR-<n>-<topic>.md`

Cursor sees this Stinger at `.claude/skills/typescript-node-stinger/` once deployed.
