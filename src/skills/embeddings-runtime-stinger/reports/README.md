# Reports - embeddings-runtime-stinger

This folder accumulates durable recommendation and audit reports produced by `embeddings-runtime-worker-bee`.

## Report types

- **Provider/runtime selection reports** - dated recommendations on hosted provider vs self-hosted (see `guides/00-selection-matrix.md`), or on whether to enable embeddings for a given workload at all (see `guides/local-daemon-05-embeddings-vs-bm25.md` for the Hivemind-specific worked version of that question).
- **Model swap reports** - recorded model or provider swap decisions following `templates/embedding-model-swap-plan.md`.
- **Dim migration reports** - completed dimension-change records following `templates/dim-migration-checklist.md`, noting the schema-heal or column-migration handoff to `vector-store-worker-bee`.
- **Runtime audit reports** - review of an existing embeddings setup against the stinger's severity rubric (must-fix / should-refactor / style): dim/schema agreement, `input_type` discipline (hosted), batching, caching, warmup discipline, quantization choice.

## Lifecycle

Reports are point-in-time documents. The runtime's ground truth (the nomic model, q8 quantization, 768 dim, the daemon architecture) is stable, so these reports age slowly, but re-validate recall claims when the corpus or query patterns change materially. Each report should state its date and a "re-evaluate when" trigger (for example, "if query patterns shift toward paraphrase-heavy recall").
