# dependency-audit Stinger

Procedural arsenal for `dependency-audit-worker-bee`, the npm supply-chain hygiene specialist for the `@deeplake/hivemind` package. This stinger encodes the 2026-current toolchain decision matrix, `npm audit` triage workflow, SBOM generation pipeline, `package-lock.json` discipline checklist, the tree-sitter native-dependency risk, and npm provenance verification - all scoped to this one npm package.

**First action when this stinger is loaded:** Read `guides/00-scanner-decision-matrix.md` to orient to the toolchain landscape before doing anything else. Every other guide assumes you have read that decision matrix.

## Repo ground truth (read before acting)

`@deeplake/hivemind` is an ESM, TypeScript ^6, Node `>=22` npm package. The supply-chain facts that matter:

- **Lockfile:** `package-lock.json` (npm - NOT pnpm or yarn). CI installs with `npm ci`.
- **Runtime deps:** `deeplake`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, `zod`, `js-yaml`, `just-bash`, `yargs-parser`.
- **optionalDependencies + native ABI risk:** `@huggingface/transformers` plus the full tree-sitter grammar set (c/cpp/go/java/javascript/python/ruby/rust/typescript). Three grammars are version-pinned in `overrides` (`tree-sitter-c`, `tree-sitter-python`, `tree-sitter-rust`). The `postinstall` hook runs `scripts/ensure-tree-sitter.mjs`, which heals native ABI / arm64 build failures. This native-dependency surface is the single biggest supply-chain risk on this package - a compromised or broken grammar build runs install-time code on every consumer's machine.
- **Publish guards:** `prepack` builds; the `files` allowlist controls what ships; `scripts/pack-check.mjs` (`npm run pack:check`) blocks publishing secrets; `scripts/audit-openclaw-bundle.mjs` (`npm run audit:openclaw`) replicates ClawHub's static scan of the OpenClaw bundle.
- **CI:** `.github/workflows/` - `ci.yaml` runs a cross-node install; `codeql.yaml` scans `javascript-typescript`. CodeRabbit profile is `chill`.

## When this stinger applies

Load this stinger when `dependency-audit-worker-bee` is invoked. Typical triggers:

- "Set up Renovate for Hivemind / Renovate vs Dependabot for this repo"
- "Our dependency-update PRs are noisy"
- "npm audit returns findings - help me triage"
- "npm audit shows clean but I don't trust it"
- "The tree-sitter postinstall is failing / is it safe?"
- "We need an SBOM for the published package"
- "Generate an SBOM and attest it in CI"
- "Set up socket.dev to catch malicious packages"
- "Should we publish with --provenance?"
- "Is our npm publish safe? / what guards the published bundle?"
- "package-lock.json keeps changing unexpectedly"

Do NOT load it for:

- Application-code CVEs requiring code changes -> `security-worker-bee`
- Container image scanning -> `ci-release-worker-bee`
- License compatibility legal opinions -> legal counsel
- CI/CD pipeline architecture beyond the dependency scanning step -> `ci-release-worker-bee`

## Critical directives

These are the non-negotiables. The full rationale lives in each guide.

- **Never recommend ignoring a CVE without requiring an expiry date and a tracking issue link.** See `guides/01-vulnerability-triage.md`.
- **Always differentiate direct vs transitive exposure before recommending an upgrade.** Most `npm audit` findings on this package are transitive and unreachable. See `guides/01-vulnerability-triage.md`.
- **Treat the tree-sitter / optionalDependencies surface as the primary install-time risk.** Any change there must keep `scripts/ensure-tree-sitter.mjs` working and must not loosen the `overrides` pins without justification. See `guides/01-vulnerability-triage.md` and `guides/03-lockfile-discipline.md`.
- **Prefer Renovate over Dependabot for this repo** because of grouping and `minimumReleaseAge`. See `guides/00-scanner-decision-matrix.md`.
- **Always validate `package-lock.json` integrity after any dependency change.** `npm ci` is the enforcement control. See `guides/03-lockfile-discipline.md`.
- **Do not gate CI on `low`/`moderate` `npm audit` findings.** Gate only on `high` and `critical`. See `guides/01-vulnerability-triage.md`.
- **Never weaken the publish guards.** The `files` allowlist, `pack-check.mjs`, and `audit:openclaw` are the publish-time defense. See `guides/04-provenance-verification.md`.
- **Defer to `security-worker-bee` for any CVE that requires patching application code, not just upgrading a package.**

## Toolchain overview (2026 state)

| Tool | Role for this package | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| **npm audit** | CVE compliance baseline, zero-config, built into the `npm ci` toolchain | Does not catch supply-chain attacks without a CVE (axios-style account hijack, tree-sitter build tampering) |
| **Renovate** | Grouped update PRs + `minimumReleaseAge` delay; right fit for this single-package npm repo | More config than Dependabot; needs a `renovate.json` |
| **Dependabot** | Free GitHub-native auto-PRs; the zero-ops fallback | No grouping, no `minimumReleaseAge`, one PR per update |
| **socket.dev** | Behavioral threat intel for npm: typosquatting, malicious install scripts, account takeover - the control for the tree-sitter postinstall risk | Not a CVE scanner; complements npm audit, does not replace it |
| **Snyk (optional)** | Richer CVE DB + reachability + IDE integration for npm | Paid tiers for some features; npm audit + socket.dev cover the baseline |
| **Syft + CycloneDX** | SBOM for the published npm package in CycloneDX 1.6 JSON; CI-ready with Sigstore attestation | Does not scan vulnerabilities; pairs with Grype for that |
| **npm `--provenance`** | Sigstore-backed provenance on publish; verifiable with `npm audit signatures` | Transport guarantee only - does not vouch for source-code trust |

> **Key 2026 insight:** `npm audit` is a CVE compliance tool, not a supply-chain security tool. The March 2026 axios maintainer account hijack published a backdoor in 40 minutes with no CVE at time of attack - `npm audit` showed clean throughout. For this package the equivalent nightmare is a tampered tree-sitter grammar running install-time code via `postinstall`. socket.dev behavioral analysis and Renovate `minimumReleaseAge` are the controls that address this class. See `research/external/04-npm-provenance-sigstore-2026.md`.
