# wiki-stinger - Companion Resources

This directory holds everything the `wiki-worker-bee` Bee needs to do its job. Organized into six layers: **guides** (procedural rules), **references** (cheat sheets loaded on demand), **templates** (page seeds copied per write), **examples** (worked invocations to mirror), **reports** (output shapes and past runs), **research** (audit trail for the guides).

> **Agent entry point:** [`.claude/agents/wiki-worker-bee.md`](../../agents/wiki-worker-bee.md) (repo-local). The agent reads files from this directory by path; it does not auto-load everything into context.

## How extraction works (read this first)

wiki-worker-bee does NOT use ts-morph. It uses **tree-sitter** - the same engine Hivemind's codebase-graph already runs in `src/graph/extract/*`. The repo ships grammars for nine languages (c, cpp, go, java, javascript, python, ruby, rust, typescript). The extractor walks the AST and emits declaration nodes (`function`, `class`, `method`, `interface`, `type_alias`, `enum`, `const`, `module`) and edges (`imports`, `calls`, `extends`, `implements`, `method_of`). wiki-worker-bee classifies those nodes into the 13-type entity catalog (see `guides/04`) and files atomic pages. Snapshots of the graph live in the Deep Lake `codebase` table as NetworkX-style node-link JSON (`snapshot_jsonb`, `snapshot_sha256`).

Output lands in the repo's `library/knowledge/` area per the schema-v2 convention: reference docs under `library/knowledge/public|private/<domain>/`, ADRs under `library/knowledge/private/architecture/ADR-<n>-<slug>.md`. Entity, concept, comparison, question, and meta pages live under the knowledge area's codebase-graph domain folder (`library/knowledge/private/codebase-graph/{entities,concepts,comparisons,questions,meta}/`).

## Decide first: which mode is this invocation?

wiki-worker-bee operates in four modes. The graph driver sets `mode` in the structured payload; for `@`-mention invocations infer the mode from user intent (and confirm with the user before writing per [`guides/02-direct-invocation.md`](guides/02-direct-invocation.md)).

| Mode | When | Write side effects |
|---|---|---|
| `document` | Initial scan, no prior knowledge-area state for this chunk | Creates entity / concept / decision / comparison pages from scratch |
| `update` | Incremental scan, prior state exists | Compares against prior, applies contradiction protocol, updates entity pages |
| `scan-directory` | User-targeted subtree scan | Same as document/update for the named subtree only |
| `lint` | Audit-only, no writes | Produces a `meta/<date>-lint-report.md` only |

## The six phases (non-lint modes)

1. **Parse the chunk** - tree-sitter for any of the nine supported grammars; filename-only stub pages for other languages.
2. **Cross-reference against prior state** - flag mismatches as contradictions for Phase 6.
3. **Author entity pages** - one per code unit, <=300 lines, full frontmatter, source citations.
4. **Author concept pages** - one per data flow / pattern / shared convention.
5. **Detect and file ADRs from commit messages** - high-confidence only; low-confidence goes to `questions/`.
6. **Apply active contradiction protocol** - four artifacts every time.

Full procedure: [`guides/03-the-six-phases.md`](guides/03-the-six-phases.md).

## The non-negotiables

Read [`guides/00-principles.md`](guides/00-principles.md) before any write. Summary:

- Never touch `index.md`, `<type>/_index.md`, `log.md`, `hot.md`, `.hivemind/file-hashes.json` - the graph driver owns global state.
- Active contradiction protocol mandatory (`[!stale]` + `[!contradiction]` + meta report + notification flag) - incomplete handling is a bug.
- Never fabricate ADRs, relationships, or git facts.
- <=300 lines per page; split if exceeded.
- Always cite source `file:line`.
- Repo-relative paths only; never absolute.
- Read-only against the codebase.
- Direct `@`-mention invocation: confirm scope before writing; flag `partial_scan: true` in the response.

## Guides - which one to read

The agent dispatches based on invocation mode and intent. Read the matching guide in full before acting.

| User intent / driver mode | Read |
|---|---|
| any invocation, first time this session | [`guides/00-principles.md`](guides/00-principles.md) |
| `document` / `update` / `scan-directory` mode | [`guides/03-the-six-phases.md`](guides/03-the-six-phases.md) |
| Phase 6 (contradiction handling) | [`guides/06-contradiction-protocol.md`](guides/06-contradiction-protocol.md) |
| invoked via `@`-mention by a Cursor user | [`guides/02-direct-invocation.md`](guides/02-direct-invocation.md), then mode-specific |
| invoked via graph driver | [`guides/01-canonical-invocation.md`](guides/01-canonical-invocation.md) |
| about to write any page | [`guides/05-atomic-page-rule.md`](guides/05-atomic-page-rule.md) |
| chunk includes files in unsupported languages | [`guides/08-stub-pages-for-unsupported-langs.md`](guides/08-stub-pages-for-unsupported-langs.md) |
| about to emit final response | [`guides/10-response-payload.md`](guides/10-response-payload.md) |
| `lint` mode | [`guides/09-lint-mode.md`](guides/09-lint-mode.md) |
| ADR detection from a commit | [`guides/07-adr-detection.md`](guides/07-adr-detection.md) |
| entity extraction tactics per type | [`guides/04-entity-extraction-by-type.md`](guides/04-entity-extraction-by-type.md) |

## References - load on demand

| Need | Open |
|---|---|
| What NOT to touch (parallel sub-agent contract) | [`references/parallel-subagent-contract.md`](references/parallel-subagent-contract.md) |
| Full frontmatter schema by page type | [`references/frontmatter-schema.md`](references/frontmatter-schema.md) |
| Four-artifact contradiction protocol with examples | [`references/contradiction-protocol.md`](references/contradiction-protocol.md) |

## Templates - copy per write

| Writing a... | Open |
|---|---|
| entity page (function, class, service, mcp-tool, queue, etc.) | [`templates/entity.md`](templates/entity.md) |
| concept page (data flow, pattern, convention) | [`templates/concept.md`](templates/concept.md) |
| ADR page (filed via Phase 5) | [`templates/decision.md`](templates/decision.md) |
| comparison page (alternative to existing pattern) | [`templates/comparison.md`](templates/comparison.md) |
| question page (gap or low-confidence ADR) | [`templates/question.md`](templates/question.md) |
| daily contradiction-report meta page | [`templates/contradiction-report.md`](templates/contradiction-report.md) |

All templates use Obsidian-flavored YAML frontmatter and `[[wikilinks]]` - both render natively in Cursor's preview pane and in any external Obsidian vault opened on the same folder.

## Reading order on first invocation

1. This README (navigation).
2. `guides/00-principles.md` (non-negotiables).
3. The mode-specific guide (per the table above).
4. `references/frontmatter-schema.md` before the first Phase-3 write.
5. `references/contradiction-protocol.md` before the first Phase-6 write.
6. `references/parallel-subagent-contract.md` once per session - internalize what NOT to touch.

## Sibling boundaries

- `library-worker-bee` writes module narratives under `library/knowledge/private/<domain>/*.md`. wiki-worker-bee does not touch that prose. See [`.claude/skills/library-stinger/README.md`](../library-stinger/README.md).
- `quality-worker-bee` writes QA reports under `library/requirements/reports/` and feature/issue `reports/` folders. wiki-worker-bee does not touch these.
- Hivemind's graph driver (`src/graph/`) owns `index.md`, `<type>/_index.md`, `log.md`, `hot.md`, `.hivemind/file-hashes.json` inside the knowledge area. wiki-worker-bee writes per-page content only.

## Future work (out of scope for v1)

- Cross-file call resolution beyond what `src/graph/resolve/cross-file.ts` already does (Phase 1.5 in the graph code).
- Embedding-based duplicate-page detection in lint mode.
- Hot cache (`hot.md`) authorship - owned by the graph driver, not wiki-worker-bee.

## For the agent (self-operation notes)

When invoked:

1. Identify the invocation path: graph driver (canonical) or `@`-mention (escape hatch).
2. If `@`-mention, follow the direct-invocation guide first - echo the inferred chunk and wait for explicit user confirmation before any writes.
3. Read `guides/00-principles.md` once per session. Treat it as non-negotiable.
4. Read the mode-specific guide in full.
5. Execute the six phases (or lint procedure) per the guide.
6. On any Phase-3 write, copy the matching template and fill it in - do not author from scratch.
7. On Phase 6, all four artifacts must land - incomplete handling is a bug.
8. Emit the structured response payload.
9. On `@`-mention invocations, set `partial_scan: true`.
10. Never touch global state files. The graph driver reconciles `index.md`, `log.md`, `hot.md`, `<type>/_index.md`, and `.hivemind/file-hashes.json` after.
