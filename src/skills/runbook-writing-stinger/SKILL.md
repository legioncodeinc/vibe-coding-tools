# runbook-writing-stinger

Operational runbook craft: the exact-command discipline, the no-implied-context rule, escalation path architecture, rollback procedures, runbook-as-test methodology, and postmortem-to-runbook linkage.

**Read this file first** to orient. Then open the guide that matches your task.

## The five core principles

These govern every decision in this stinger. Full justification with failure modes per principle in `guides/00-principles.md`.

1. **No implied context.** Every command is copy-pasteable. Every URL is absolute. Every env var is defined. Every decision point is explicit. A runbook written for "someone who knows the system" is not a runbook.
2. **Exact-command discipline.** No "something like `npm run embeddings:status`." Exact flags, exact dataset paths, exact daemon names. Vague commands create incident-time variance.
3. **Explicit escalation paths.** Every runbook names its escalation contact (person, team, channel) with a response-time expectation. "Escalate if needed" is not an escalation path.
4. **Rollback before you ship.** Every state-changing step has an undo step or an explicit irreversibility acknowledgment. Rollback is never improvised during an incident.
5. **Runbook-as-test mandate.** An untested runbook is a hypothesis. Exercise runbooks quarterly (game day) and on every postmortem action item. Mark untested runbooks prominently.

**Research anchor:** Google SRE Book Chapter 11 defines on-call as requiring co-equal resources: clear escalation paths, well-defined procedures, and blameless postmortem culture. All five principles map directly to this triad. See `research/external/2026-sre-google-being-on-call-chapter.md`.

| Task | Guide |
|---|---|
| Learn the five principles and their failure modes | `guides/00-principles.md` |
| Choose which runbook type to write | `guides/01-runbook-types.md` |
| Audit an existing runbook for no-implied-context violations | `guides/02-no-implied-context-audit.md` |
| Structure escalation paths correctly | `guides/03-escalation-path-architecture.md` |
| Write rollback sections | `guides/04-rollback-procedures.md` |
| Plan and execute a game day / runbook exercise | `guides/05-runbook-as-test.md` |
| Link a postmortem action item to a runbook | `guides/06-postmortem-linkage.md` |
| Validate a runbook before marking it ready | `guides/07-done-checklist.md` |
| See a full worked example | `examples/happy-path-break-fix.md` |

## When this stinger activates

This stinger is pre-loaded by `runbook-writing-worker-bee`. Do not load it independently unless you are the Bee.

Trigger contexts:

- "Write a runbook for the [service/alert]"
- "Our runbook for [X] is outdated"
- "Audit this runbook" + paste of existing doc
- "Turn this postmortem action item into a runbook"
- "We need to run a game day / exercise our runbooks"
- "Our on-call docs are weak / missing / wrong"
- Postmortem with action item: "Write runbook for [failure mode]"
- PR or code change that introduces a new failure mode without a runbook

Do NOT activate for:
- PagerDuty / OpsGenie configuration (ci-release-worker-bee)
- Infrastructure provisioning decisions embedded in runbooks (ci-release-worker-bee owns the what; this stinger owns the how-to-document-it)
- Incident culture or postmortem process design beyond the document format (library-worker-bee)

## Runbook types at a glance

Three types, three templates. Details in `guides/01-runbook-types.md`.

| Type | When to use | Template |
|---|---|---|
| **Break-fix** | Alert fires, service degraded, on-call responds | `templates/break-fix-runbook.md` |
| **Scheduled operation** | Planned maintenance, deployment window, DR drill | `templates/scheduled-operation-runbook.md` |
| **Diagnostic** | Root-cause investigation, "it's slow but not paged" | `templates/diagnostic-runbook.md` |

## Open questions from research (flags for the user)

The following were surfaced by `scripture-historian` and were not resolved by the Command Brief. Flag to the user before finalizing any guide that touches these areas:

1. **Runbook-as-code scope**: Should this stinger cover automation hooks (Rundeck, AWS SSM, Jupyter notebooks)? Research shows 2026 SRE practice increasingly blurs manual vs. automated runbooks. Current stance: manual runbooks only; automation is an advanced pattern flagged in `guides/01-runbook-types.md` as "out of scope, see ci-release-worker-bee."
2. **Security attribute**: The SRE School quality model adds "no exposed secrets, least privilege commands" as a ninth attribute. Added to `guides/07-done-checklist.md` as a checklist item; flag to user if their environment has PCI/HIPAA compliance requirements.
3. **Alert-links-to-runbook principle**: Added as Principle 6 in `guides/00-principles.md` ("Alert linking"), the alert payload must directly link to the specific runbook, not a runbook index.
4. **Freshness KPIs**: Added postmortem action item completion rate as a KPI in `guides/07-done-checklist.md`. User should decide whether to track in a dashboard.
5. **Storage tooling**: This stinger is tool-agnostic (Notion, Confluence, Slab, Git/Backstage all work). Tool-specific tips are callouts in `guides/00-principles.md`.

> TODO: open question, if the user's org uses runbook automation tools (Rundeck, Shoreline, AWS SSM), a future `runbook-writing-worker-bee` would own the integration layer. Flag this need if it surfaces.

## Critical directives (verbatim from Command Brief)

- **Never use implied commands.** See `guides/02-no-implied-context-audit.md`.
- **Never skip the escalation path.** See `guides/03-escalation-path-architecture.md`.
- **Always include rollback for every state-changing step.** See `guides/04-rollback-procedures.md`.
- **Mark untested runbooks prominently.** See `guides/05-runbook-as-test.md`.
- **Apply the five-minute rule.** A runbook requiring more than five minutes to understand enough to execute is too long. Split it or add a prominent TL;DR summary at the top.
